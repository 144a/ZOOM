# ZOOM

I was working on a new version of snake for the calculator that only used the pixel test function to determine where the end of the snake was and to remove it in the correct direction, when I ran into a couple of issues regarding my drawing functions. I needed a way to better see what I had been doing on the graph screen, so I made this to "zoom" into the area I wanted to see better. You just type in the x and y values of the top right corner, and it will display a 10x26 area of pixel states, represented by a zero (on) or a space (off). Hopefully some other people find this useful.

The text files allow for easy observation of the code with out the ti connect editor.
